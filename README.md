# Compiler-Project
### This is a toy compiler written in C for course CSF363 - Compiler construction and Designing at BITS Pilani
#### Note for juniors: Details of components which were successfully implemented are written in coding details.docx refer it before using the code. Though the Grammar is least likely to change over years but I would recommend you to code your project from scratch. The poject would initially look waste of time, but trust me you'ld get to learn a lot from it!
